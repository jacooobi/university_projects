# Komunikacja Czlowiek Komputer

During this class I worked with most popular python technologies and libraries. Notebooks, matplotlib, numpy, sympy, scikit-learn.

There are two projects:
- Gender recognition - given a wav file with a voice sample program tries to distinguish the speaker's gender (co-authored with Tomasz Kasperek (@kasperekt))
- QR Code recognition - given an input image the program looks for a white sheet of paper with qr code printed on it. (co-authored with Marcin Chmiel (@mewa))
